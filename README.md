This project showcases an integrated approach to combating misinformation in the digital age through Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, wrapped in a user-friendly Flask web application developed in Python.
At its core, the project leverages a Decision Tree Classifier trained on a dataset of news articles labeled as either reliable or unreliable. The articles undergo rigorous preprocessing, including text cleaning, stemming, and vectorization, to transform them into numerical representations suitable for ML model training.
The Flask web application provides a seamless interface for users to input news articles, which are then subjected to the trained model for reliability prediction. The prediction process involves preprocessing the user input, passing it through the model, and presenting the prediction result—reliable or unreliable—back to the user.
The project encompasses various stages, from dataset preparation to model training and deployment. It emphasizes the importance of robust preprocessing techniques in NLP tasks and showcases the effectiveness of ML models in classifying news articles.
Overall, this project serves as a practical demonstration of how NLP, ML, and AI can be combined with web development frameworks like Flask to create impactful tools for combating misinformation and promoting media literacy in the digital realm.
